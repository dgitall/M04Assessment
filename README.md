# M04Assessment

Note: The PowerBI dashboard for this project can be shared on request. (dgerber@dev-10.com)  
## Introduction
In the Power BI module, we covered everything from creating a report to using slicers, groups, and bins, customizing visualizations, using quick insights, and working with Excel.

For this assignment, use the the 911 Calls for Service in the Last 30 days data set. Download the latest data set as CVS.

Consider the situation:
The Detroit Police leadership team is trying to understand recent data: They would like to quickly see trends and answer the questions like the following:

* Are the number of 911 calls increasing or decreasing over 30 the day period?
* Are the number of 911 calls increasing differently in different districts?
* What are the trends per council_district for average response time?
* What is the count of each category of crime as reflected in the 911 calls?
* Are the number of call categories different per district?
Parts 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 should be included in a PDF document with all images and feedback. Please be sure to include your name and "Power BI Assessment". Organize the PDF so each section is easily referenced.

Part 2 should be included as a Power BI report file.

## Part 1: Create a napkin drawing for a Power BI report and receive classmate feedback
Before starting part one, reflect on who the audience is for your napkin drawing. What technical level does the leadership team have? What might the culture of the leadership team reflect? How do they plan on using this report?

Hand-draw a mockup of the report you are interested in creating. Share the hand-drawn mockup with 2 classmates and record feedback on your napkin drawing from classmates. Your assessment should include the before feedback napkin drawing, classmate feedback, and after feedback napkin drawing.

## Part 2: Create a Power BI report based on the napkin drawing
Using Power BI, create a report that allows the leadership team to answer the following:

* Are the number of 911 calls increasing or decreasing over 30 the day period?
* Are the number of 911 calls increasing differently in different districts?
* What are the trends per council district for average response times?
* What is the count of each category of crime as reflected in the 911 calls?
* Are the number of call categories different per district?
Your report must include:

* Your Power BI report must use at least one Slicer.
* Your Power BI report must use one example of groups.
* Your Power BI report must use one example of bins.
Include the pbix file from the Power BI Dashboard in your assessment.

## Part 3: Create a napkin drawing and formal mockup for a Dashboard to be Shared with the Public.
The Leadership team also wants you to create a Dashboard via the Power BI web portal that will be available to the public who live in the area with high-level key performance indicators.

As an outside contractor, you may or may not be familiar with Detroit. Please use the internet to gain demographic and cultural insights about the residents. Reflect on how what the public needs may be different than the leadership team.

Create a napkin drawing and then a full-color mockup for your dashboard. You can reuse parts of your report in your dashboard.

Key indicators should include but are not limited to:

* Number of calls per day
* Average response rate
* Types of calls per day
As this dashboard is for the public, with the napkin drawing create a full formal color mockup of what you are planning. Please be mindful of the accessibility concerns as this dashboard is intended for the public. Remember, dashboards give high-level snapshots.

Seek out feedback from 2 classmates. and adjust your napkin and full mockup accordingly. Turn in pre and post feedback mockups and classmate feedback.

## Part 4: Create a Power BI Dashboard on the Napkin drawing
From your full-color mockup create the Power BI dashboard. You may reuse parts of the report in the Dashboard.

Please Note:

* Your Dashboard must have at least one visualization.
* Your Dashboard must have at least one set of cells from a published Excel workbook.
* Must include the accessibility notes from the Design Lesson.
## Part 5: Using DataFlows and PowerBI create an Auto ML predictive analysis.
The Leadership team wants you to use Power BI to create an Auto ML Predictive Analysis to predict the dispatch time for a call based on the other columns. Ideally, the Leadership team would like to predict an estimate of dispatch time using a minimum amount of fields.

For this analysis, use the full 911 Detroit call data set

Please Note: this takes some time to download and this will take 30+ minutes to run. This analysis requires Power Bi Premium which you should have available. If you do not have access to Power Bi Premium, please contact your instructor and/or IT support.

For the assessment, please include screenshots of the model performance, accuracy report, and training details pages.

## Part 6: Write a 1-2 page summary report on Auto ML Results
* What are the most independent columns to predict dispatch time?
* Explain how to run the model on new Excel files with data and what must be in the Excel files for any predictions (screenshots are acceptable)
* Explain to the non-technical leadership team whether or not they should trust this model based on the Accuracy Report in the Power BI results.
* Based on your research of Power BI and Auto ML, give some suggestions on what might improve the score.
